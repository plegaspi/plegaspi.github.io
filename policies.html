            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>The Tactical Tek Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by
                ecoATM, LLC (doing business as Tactical Tek) ("Tactical Tek", "we" or "us") when you access and use
                Tactical Tek's
                websites, applications and services (collectively, the "Services") that link to this Privacy Policy.
                This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other kiosks, websites or other online or mobile services or
                applications of ecoATM, LLC or its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates.</p>

            <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

            <p>When you use the Services, you provide information to us. Tactical Tek collects two types of
                information: (1)
                information that you provide to us that lets us know who you are ("Personally Identifiable
                Information") and (2) information that does not by itself identify a specific individual
                ("Non-personally Identifiable Information").</p>

            <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

            <p>You can browse the Services' Websites without telling Tactical Tek who you are or revealing any personal
                information about yourself. However, when you transact with us (e.g., offer to sell a device) or
                register to open an account with Tactical Tek, we ask for information about yourself, such as your
                name,
                email address, and zip code, which we collect and use as disclosed in this Privacy Policy. Once you
                submit information about yourself to us, you are not anonymous to us. We may also collect additional
                information about you when you engage in certain activities on the Services, such as: (a) provide
                transactional information when you sell, donate, offer to recycle, ship, or purchase an item; (b) when
                you sign up for special offers; (c) when you visit the Services' Web pages or the pages of certain
                Tactical Tek partners ; (d) when you interact with offers and advertisements; (e) when you contact us
                for
                help or customer support; (f) when you log into the Services with your account; (g) when you complete a
                survey; (h) when you post content or provide us with feedback; or (i) when you enter promotions or
                sweepstakes. Tactical Tek might also receive information about you from other sources and add it to
                your
                account information. Providing information is purely optional on your part; however, not all features
                and services (such as, responding to your inquiries) would be available to you if you elect not to
                provide information. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer
                and storage of that information by us.</p>

            <h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

            <p>We automatically receive and collect Non-personally Identifiable Information on our server logs from
                your browser, including your IP address, the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from,
                which URL you next go to, browser type, browser language, date and time of your query, Tactical Tek
                cookie
                information, and the pages you request. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal
                and an aggregated basis. We may use third-party analytics services to collect, monitor and analyze the
                information collected as described above.</p>

            <h3>Use of Information</h3>

            <p>We primarily will use Personally Identifiable Information for the following purposes: (a) to provide the
                Services to you; (b) to customize the advertising and content you see; (c) fulfill any transactions,
                including, your requests for products and services ; (d) improve our services and offerings to you; (e)
                conduct research ; (f) provide you with support; (g) provide you with updates and notices about the
                Services, our Privacy Policy and terms and conditions; (h) contact you under certain circumstances; (i)
                provide you with offers from us, our affiliates and from third parties that may be of interest to you,
                and (j) provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. In addition, Tactical Tek will
                use
                your email address to contact you under the following circumstances: to respond to your support
                questions, to notify you of material changes to our policies or website, to request your participation
                in user surveys, and to deliver products, services and marketing communications that you request.</p>

            <p>We will use Non-personally Identifiable Information to diagnose problems with our servers and software,
                to administer the Services, and to gather demographic information. Our third-party advertising networks
                and servers will also provide us reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon
                on Tactical Tek in a manner that does not identify personally any individual.</p>

            <h3>Cookies</h3>

            <p>Tactical Tek may set and access Tactical Tek cookies on your computer. Upon your first visit to the
                Services, a
                cookie is sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. A "cookie" is a small file
                containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer and stored on your hard drive when you
                visit a website; many major Web services use them to provide useful features for their users. Each web
                site can send its own cookie to your browser. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You
                can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent; however if you
                reject cookies, you will not be able to sign in to the Services or take full advantage of our Services.
                Tactical Tek uses cookies for the following general purposes: (a) to track your preferences, such as
                the
                address or local zip code you enter; (b) to access your information when you sign in so we can provide
                you with your personalized content; (c) to display the most appropriate advertisements, based on your
                interests and activity on our web site; and (d) and to help us analyze and estimate our traffic and use
                of features on the Services.</p>

            <p>We may also use "pixel tags," which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of the
                Services. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded
                the page on which the tag appears; the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time (and
                length of time) the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser that retrieved the
                pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie previously placed by that server on your
                computer. We may use pixel tags, either provided by us or by our third party advertisers and ad
                networks, to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click
                and other actions taken in connection with our sites and Services and use them in combination with our
                cookies to provide offers and information of interest to you.</p>

            <p>We also may allow certain analytic services and providers of applications used on the Services (e.g.
                sharing buttons) to collect Non-Personally Identifiable information by placing cookies on the Services
                that will track certain performance of our Services, such as, web traffic, click-throughs, etc., in
                order to assist us and our service providers in better understanding the interests of our users and to
                better serve those interests.</p>

            <h3>Advertising</h3>

            <p>We may use other companies under agreements with us to serve advertisements when you visit and use the
                Services. These companies may collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable Information during your
                visits to the Services and other Web sites in order to
                provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These
                companies typically use a cookie, a third party web beacon and/or pixel tags to collect this
                information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice in general and the options that
                you have, including your option or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit
                www.networkadvertising.org. These cookies, web beacons and pixel tags do not collect any personal
                information from your computer, such as your e-mail address. Other companies' use of their cookies is
                subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access
                to Tactical Tek's cookies.</p>

            <h3>Targeted Advertising By Tactical Tek</h3>

            <p>In order to serve offers and advertisements that may be interest to our users, we may display targeted
                advertisements on the Services based on Personally Identifiable Information provided by our users,
                including zip code and profile. We do not provide this Personally Identifiable Information to our
                advertisers when you interact with such an advertisement. However, please note that the advertisers
                (including ad serving companies) may determine based on their own analysis that a user who interacts
                with an advertisement targeted by Tactical Tek may fit into a certain demographical category; for
                example,
                an advertiser may determine that men ages 25-34 are interacting with a certain advertisement on
                Tactical Tek
                from a particular geographic area. You acknowledge that any information collected by such advertisers
                or advertising networks – and any options that you have with the use of such information – would be
                handled in accordance with the disclosures provided above in the "Advertising" section.</p>

            <h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

            <p>Tactical Tek does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or
                nonaffiliated
                companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or
                under the following circumstances:</p>

            <p>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Tactical Tek under
                confidentiality agreements. These trusted partners include companies with which Tactical Tek may
                operate
                co-branded websites or web-pages to expand their services using Tactical Tek's Services. These trusted
                partners may use your personal information to provide services to you on our behalf, evaluate the
                effectiveness of the services, and to help Tactical Tek communicate with you about offers from Tactical
                Tek and
                our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this
                information. We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our
                legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>

            <p>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action
                regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical
                safety of any person, violations of Tactical Tek's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. We
                may
                transfer information about you if Tactical Tek is acquired by or merged with another company. In this
                event,
                Tactical Tek will post a notice on its website before information about you is transferred and becomes
                subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

            <p>The sites displayed as search results or linked to by the Services are developed by people over whom
                Tactical Tek exercises no control. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer,
                collect
                data or solicit personal information. Tactical Tek may present links in a format that enables us to
                understand whether they have been followed. We use this information to understand and improve the
                quality of Tactical Tek's search technology. For instance, this data helps us determine how often users
                are
                satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results.</p>

            <h3>Social Media Plug-ins</h3>

            <p>Social media plug-ins of social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Yahoo, Windows and Google
                plus (among others) are integrated on Tactical Tek's website. Where Tactical Tek sites contain a
                plug-in to a
                social network, these are clearly marked (e.g. with a Facebook button). If you chose to click on one of
                these buttons or links, your browser connects directly to the servers of the relevant social network.
                The social network directly transmits the content of the plugin to your browser. If you are registered
                on the relevant social network and logged into your respective account the social network receives the
                information that the web page was used by you. If you interact with a social network plug-in (e.g. you
                press the Facebook "Like" –feature, the Twitter "Tweet this" feature and Google plus "1+" button or
                equivalent) or drop a comment on the appropriate web page, the corresponding information is directly
                transmitted to the relevant social network from your browser. If you are not registered with the social
                network or you are logged out before you visit Tactical Tek's website, there is the possibility that at
                least your IP address will be submitted to and stored by the social network. If you interact with us
                through a social media platform, plug-in etc. then you may be permitting us to have on-going access to
                some limited information from your social network profile (such as name, email address, photo, gender,
                location, the people/sites you follow etc.).</p>

            <p>If you do not want the social network to collect the information about you described above, or to share
                it with Tactical Tek and other third parties, please review the privacy policy of the relevant social
                network and/or log out of the relevant social network before you visit Tactical Tek's site. As with
                other
                sites, you may be able delete any existing cookies placed on your computer by the social network via
                your browser.</p>

            <h3>Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences</h3>

            <p>Registered users can edit their Tactical Tek account information, including contact preferences, at any
                time
                from their "My Account" account management page which you can find at
                www.tacticaltek.com.com/account/login. We
                may, from time to time, send you e-mail regarding our products and services and third party products
                and services that may be of interest to you. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any further
                mailings at any time; provided, however, that we reserve the right to send you certain communications
                relating to the Services, such as (a) communications related to fulfilling a transaction, (b) service
                announcements, (c) notices regarding Tactical Tek's legal terms and this Privacy Policy; and (d)
                administrative messages, which are considered part of your Tactical Tek account. You will not have the
                opportunity to opt-out of receiving such notices.</p>

            <p>You can delete your Tactical Tek registered account by requesting an account deletion via email to
                support@tacticaltek.com.com. You must provide us with the email address of the registered account.
                After we
                have confirmed your request via email, we will remove access to your personal information from our user
                database.</p>

            <h3>Confidentiality and Security</h3>

            <p>We limit access to personal information about you to our employees and agents who we believe reasonably
                need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to
                do their jobs. Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We treat data as
                an asset that must be protected and use many tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to
                protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties
                may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse
                or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we work very
                hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal
                information or private communications will always remain private. Because email and instant messaging
                are not recognized as secure communications, we request that you not send private information to us by
                email or instant messaging services.</p>

            <h3>Third Parties</h3>

            <p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. This
                policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Tactical Tek does not own or control or to
                people
                that Tactical Tek does not employ or manage. The Services may include applications, content and/or ads
                from
                third parties that may perform user activity tracking in addition to that described herein; Tactical
                Tek
                accepts no responsibility for said activities. Tactical Tek does not control the privacy policies of
                third
                parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We
                encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others. For more
                information about each such third party, please refer to the third party's privacy policy.</p>

            <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>

            <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. All amended
                terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are initially posted on the Services, unless that
                amendment states otherwise. In addition, we will notify you about significant changes in the way we
                treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Tactical
                Tek
                account or by placing a prominent notice on our site. If you do not agree to the changes, you may
                terminate your account by requesting an account deletion via email to support@tacticaltek.com.com. You
                must
                provide us with the email address of the registered account.</p>

            <p>Tactical Tek is intended for general audiences. Tactical Tek does not collect or maintain information

                anyone
                under 13.</p>

            <p>If you are a California resident, in addition to the rights set forth above, you have the right to
                request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of your personal
                information with third parties, for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. California law
                provides that you have the right to submit a request to us at the designated address and receive the
                following information: the categories of information we disclosed to third parties for the third
                parties direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year, the names and addresses of third
                parties that received such information, and if the nature of a third party's business cannot be
                reasonably determined from the third party's name, examples of the products or services marketed.</p>

                    certain

                    Products
                    for which you have already accepted an offer, which is good for thirty (30) days, except as set

                    to You.</li>
                <li>Condition Defined for Trade-In and Purchase. Tactical Tek uses three (3) basic Product
                    conditions
                    to
                    grade Products for Trade-In, ranging from "Flawless" or "No Noticeable Flaws" to "Broken" or
                    "Functional or physical problems." Conditions can vary widely between categories and types of
                    Products. Broadly, Tactical Tek's Product definitions are as follows: Flawless or No Noticeable
                    flaws:
                    the item looks like it has never been used and is 100% functional. Good or Normal wear and
                    tear:
                    the item has visible signs of use, but is otherwise 100% functional. Broken or Functional or
                    physical problems: the item does not turn on, one or more Product functions is non-operative or
                    the
                    item has serious physical damage that inhibits use (e.g. broken or cracked screen or missing
                    parts).  The above definitions are broad guidelines. More specific condition definitions
                    specific
                    to the category and/ or type of Product may be included on the Tactical Tek Website offer
                    screen
                    and
                    serve as the effective condition definition for that product. Condition definitions are subject
                    to
                    change at Tactical Tek's discretion. If you are uncertain about your Product's condition,
                    please
                    seek
                    guidance by contacting Tactical Tek's customer care.&nbsp;<br> <br>Tactical Tek offers two (2)

                    want
                    to accept the offer, you will need to open another transaction with us at which point, assuming
                    the
                    Product is still eligible for purchase, the new offer may be different as Product prices are

                    charges
                    related to your Product, whether you incur such charges before, during or after your use of the
                    Services. It is also your responsibility to remove any security codes that would prevent use of
                    any
                    Product.</li>
                <li>Sending Tactical Tek Your Product for Trade-In or Return. When packaging your Product, be sure
                    to
                    include all materials included in your description when we calculated your offer for Trade-In,
                    or,
                    in the case of Purchase, include all materials provided by Tactical Tek in the package you
                    received. For
                    Trade-In, this may include software, accessories, adapters, and manuals. Failure to include any
                    items you told us about when the offer was calculated, or sending us a Product which does not
                    match
                    your original description, may impact the final value of your Product and may result in a
                    revised
                    offer.</li>
                <li>Removing Data From Your Product. For Products involving devices that store files and/or
                    personal
                    data on hard drives, memory chips or the like, you must back up and store any data you wish to
                    keep
                    from your Product and remove any personal information from the Product before you send your
                    Product
                    to us for Trade-In. Likewise for Products you Purchase from Tactical Tek and returned to
                    Tactical
                    Tek in
                    accordance with these Terms, you agree to remove any such data from the Product prior to
                    returning
                    the Product to Tactical Tek. Tactical Tek's standard practice is to remove all such data from
                    the
                    Product;
                    however, Tactical Tek makes no guarantee that it will do so. By sending Tactical Tek the
                    Product,
                    you agree
                    to release us from any claim as to the Product, the data stored in such Product, or any
                    information
                    on any media used in conjunction with the Product and which you send to Tactical Tek (whether
                    in
                    connection with a Trade-In or a Purchase), or for such data's security, integrity,
                    confidentiality,
                    disclosure or use. Tactical Tek is not responsible for: (a) any loss suffered by you due to any
                    data
                    that is not erased from the device and transferred to a third party, or (b) any loss of data
                    after
                    you submitted the Product to us.</li>
                <li>Product Inspection; Offer Recalculation. Your Trade-in Product must be received by Tactical Tek
                    within
                    thirty (30) days after you accept the original offer provided by Tactical Tek and complete the
                    check-
                    out process on the Tactical Tek Website (the "Delivery Period") or the offer shall
                    automatically
                    expire.
                    Packing and shipping recommendations provided to you by Tactical Tek should be followed in
                    order to
                    avoid possible damage to or loss of the Product in transit. Tactical Tek will inspect all
                    Products
                    that
                    are received. Tactical Tek has the option to accept or reject the Product, including without
                    limitation,
                    to reject any Product not conforming to the description you provided to us, any Product
                    modified in
                    such a way that it no longer conforms to the original factory specifications, any Product no
                    longer
                    complying with applicable laws or regulations (e.g., FCC rules, etc.) and/or any Product
                    damaged or
                    lost in transit. If Tactical Tek rejects the Product for any of these reasons, the original
                    offer
                    automatically expires and is rescinded. Tactical Tek reserves the right to revoke the original
                    offer and
                    provide a revised offer for the Product if: (a) the Product and/or materials are not as
                    described,
                    (b) the Product is received by Tactical Tek after the Delivery Period, and/or (c) Tactical Tek
                    receives
                    Product(s) that are different from those identified when your offer was calculated. As
                    described
                    above, Tactical Tek typically honors the offer price you receive for your Product on the Site
                    for a
                    period of thirty (30 days); sometimes for a longer period of time in connection with a
                    temporary
                    extended price-lock offer (each a "Price-Lock Offer"). Notwithstanding any Price-Lock Offer,
                    Tactical Tek always reserves the right to recalculate the original offer price and provide a
                    revised
                    offer for the Product if, during the Price-Lock Offer period, the market price for your Product
                    has
                    declined by more than thirty percent. Tactical Tek shall determine the market price during such
                    applicable period and whether there has been any such decline in its sole discretion. If you
                    elect
                    not to accept the recalculated offer price, your Product will be returned to you.</li>
                <li>Recalculated Product Offers after Inspection. In the event Tactical Tek recalculates the offer
                    it
                    provided for the Product after it has been received and inspected for Trade-In, as described
                    above,
                    you shall have the option of accepting or rejecting the new offer. If you accept the new offer,
                    you
                    will be paid in normal course and in accordance with these service terms. If you reject the new
                    offer, Tactical Tek will return the Product to you at the address from which it was originally
                    sent.
                    Tactical Tek will give you a period of five (5) days after Tactical Tek presents you with a
                    recalculated
                    offer via email at the address you provided to accept or reject the new offer (the "New Offer
                    Period"). Tactical Tek will also remind you of the outstanding new offer one or more times
                    during
                    the
                    New Offer Period. However, if the new offer is neither affirmatively accepted nor rejected by
                    you
                    during the New Offer Period, the new offer will be deemed to have been accepted by you and you
                    will
                    be paid the new offer price in the normal course and in accordance with these service terms.
                    For
                    the avoidance of doubt, your acceptance of the original offer and/or any new offer is final and
                    you
                    may not change your mind later about accepting such offer.</li>
                <li>Releasing Rights to Product. Once you send Tactical Tek your Product for Trade-In, Tactical Tek
                    cannot and
                    does not guarantee that it will be able to honor any request for return of the Product and/or
                    any
                    data or information contained in such Product. Of course, if Tactical Tek rejects the Product
                    or
                    you do
                    not accept any new offer for the Product pursuant to Sections 9 and 10 ("Return
                    Circumstances"),
                    your Product will be returned to you as set forth in Sections 9 and 10.</li>
                <li>Risk-Of-Loss. You remain responsible for the risk-of-loss for the Products sent to Tactical Tek
                    for
                    Trade-In until delivery of the same to Tactical Tek. You are responsible for any damages that
                    may
                    occur
                    to your Product while in transit. Tactical Tek is responsible for risk-of-loss when it opens
                    the
                    packaging containing your Product and ceases in the event Tactical Tek returns your product to
                    you
                    for
                    any reason. For the avoidance of doubt, in such event, risk of loss will be transferred to you
                    once
                    Tactical Tek delivers the package to the carrier for return to you and you will bear the
                    risk-of-loss
                    while the Product is in transit.&nbsp;<br> <br>If you return a Product to Tactical Tek that you
                    Purchased, you are responsible for the risk-of-loss for the Product until Tactical Tek receives
                    the
                    Product. You are responsible for any damages that may occur to the Product while in transit
                    back to
                    Tactical Tek.</li>
                <li>Passing of Title. Title to the applicable Product sent to Tactical Tek for Trade-In passes to
                    Tactical Tek
                    upon Tactical Tek's acceptance of the Product for the original offer or the new offer, as
                    applicable. If
                    there is a Return Circumstance, title shall not pass and shall remain with you.</li>
                <li>Non-Transferable. Any offer by Tactical Tek for your Product for Trade-In is non- transferable
                    and
                    not
                    redeemable for any other consideration other than what is offered by Tactical Tek.</li>
                <li>Import and Export Laws. You agree to comply fully with all import and export laws, regulations,
                    rules and orders of the United States, or any foreign government agency or authority, and that
                    you
                    will not directly or indirectly transfer any Product without proper authorization from the U.S.
                    and/or foreign government. You bear responsibility for and assume all expenses relating to your
                    compliance with the described laws, regulations, rules and orders, and for obtaining all
                    necessary
                    authorizations and clearances in order to convey any Product to Tactical Tek in connection with
                    a
                    Trade-In, including without limitation, valuation, classification and duties applicable with
                    the
                    import of any goods. Please note: U.S. trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign
                    Assets
                    Control (OFAC) generally prohibit the importation into the United States (including U.S.
                    territories), either directly or indirectly, of most goods, technology, or services (except
                    information and informational materials) from, or which originated from Cuba, Iran, Iraq,
                    Libya,
                    North Korea, Serbia, or Sudan; from foreign persons designated by the Secretary of State as
                    having
                    promoted the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; named Foreign Terrorist
                    Organizations;
                    designated terrorists and narcotics traffickers. You may not offer or provide to Tactical Tek
                    for
                    sale,
                    any Products that would violate the provisions of this Section 15.</li>
                <li>Promotions. From time to time, and at Tactical Tek's sole discretion, Tactical Tek may offer
                    promotional
                    programs as an incentive to customers. Promotions applicable to payments are applied as an
                    increment to the final value of a customer's Product, but they are not considered a change in
                    that
                    final value. Promotional programs have explicitly defined terms, including but not limited to,
                    expiration, usage per person and per transaction, and other limitations and restrictions.
                    Unless
                    otherwise stated, promotions must be applied by you before checkout. For the avoidance of
                    doubt,
                    once checkout is completed, promotions cannot be applied to the same transaction. Tactical Tek
                    reserves
                    the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel or refuse promotions.</li>
                <li>Accuracy of all Information. Tactical Tek makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of all
                    information
                    you receive in relation to your Product. From time to time, however, there may be typographical
                    errors, technical inaccuracies, pricing or other errors or omissions. As such, Tactical Tek
                    reserves the
                    right, at any time prior to payment, to:(a) Correct an error. (b) Change the offer or cancel
                    the
                    Purchase prior to your receipt of the Product. In the event the Product has already been sent
                    to
                    Tactical Tek for Trade-In, the changed offer will become a New Offer subject to the processes
                    set
                    forth
                    in Section 9 and Section 10. Otherwise, the changed offer will be a re-issued original offer,
                    which
                    you may accept or reject. (c) Void a transaction. If the Product was already sent to Tactical
                    Tek,
                    Tactical Tek will be deemed to have rejected the Product resulting in a Return Circumstance
                    subject
                    to
                    Section 11.</li>
                <li>Privacy. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information about how we collect, use and
                    disclose

                    filtered
                    or stopped by spam filters or other types of email blocking functionalities. If you no longer
                    desire to transact electronically with us, you may no longer use the Tactical Tek Websites. You

                    that
                    interferes with or disrupts the Services or performance of the Tactical Tek Websites.</li>
