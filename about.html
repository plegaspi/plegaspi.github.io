        <p class="description">
          We believe that we’re on the face of the Earth to make great products.
          We believe in the simple, not the complex.
          We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products we make.
          We participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution.
          We believe in saying no to thousands of projects so that we can really focus on the few that are truly
          important and meaningful to us.
          We believe in deep collaboration and cross-pollination of our groups, which allow us to innovate in a way
          that others cannot.
          We don’t settle for anything less than excellence in every group in the company, and we have the self-honesty
          to admit when we’re wrong and the courage to change.
